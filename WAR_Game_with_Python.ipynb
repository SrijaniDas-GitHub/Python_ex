    " The deck is divided evenly among the two players, giving each a face-down stack. \n",
    " \n",
    " In unison, each player reveals the top card on his stack (a \"battle\") and the player with the higher card takes both the cards played and moves them to the bottom of his stack. \n",
    " \n",
    " If the two cards played are of equal value, each player lays down three face-down cards and a fourth card face-up (a \"war\"), and the higher-valued card wins all of the cards on the table, which are then added to the bottom of the player's stack. \n",
    " \n",
    " In the case of another tie, the war process is repeated until there is no tie. \n",
    " \n",
    " A player wins by collecting all the cards. If a player runs out of cards while dealing the face-down cards of a war, he may play the last card in his deck as his face-up card and still have a chance to stay in the game."
