# [Project 1 : WAR GAME](https://github.com/SrijaniDas-GitHub/Python_exercise/blob/master/WAR_Game_with_Python.ipynb)

The Rules. (from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)) 
- The deck is divided evenly among two players, giving each a face-down stack. 
- In unison, each player reveals the top card on his stack and the player with the higher card takes both the cards played and moves them to the bottom of his stack. 
- If the two cards played are of equal value, each player lays down three face-down cards and a fourth card face-up (a "war"), and the higher-valued card wins all of the cards on the table, which are then added to the bottom of the player's stack. 
- In the case of another tie, the war process is repeated until there is no tie. 
A player wins by collecting all the cards. If a player runs out of cards while dealing the face-down cards of a war, he may play the last card in his deck as his face-up card and still have a chance to stay in the game.

This game can continue forever!
